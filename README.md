## Overview
This project aims to classify garbage into different categories using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various types of garbage, and the classification results are displayed through a Streamlit web application.

## Features
- Image Classification: Upload an image to get real-time predictions on whether the object is recyclable or considered as trash.
- Video Classification: Upload a video to see real-time classification results for each frame.

## Model
The classification model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Various pre-trained models such as VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet have been experimented with, and the best-performing model has been integrated into the Streamlit app.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning
- Streamlit for web application
- OpenCV for image and video processing

## Getting Started
To run the Streamlit app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/garbage-classification.git
   cd garbage-classification
